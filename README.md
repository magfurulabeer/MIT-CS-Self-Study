# MIT CS Self-Study
This is my personal attempt to complete the MIT undergraduate computer science degree portion using MIT OCW. I commit to starting this journey once I get a steady paying job. Currently 4 of the required courses are unavailable on OCW. I listed 8 other courses that I might use to fill in the gap.
